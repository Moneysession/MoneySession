						<h3>It's in the ADN</h3>
						<p>Human nature and emotional trading are hardwired into the herd's personality. No matter what strategies or trading systems they use, these behaviours will manifest themselves so commonly that retail traders begin to act the same way across multiple timeframes and financial assets, creating behavioral patterns that are both predictable and exploitable. The herd will always sell into an uptrend and buy into a downtrend. The herd positioning is almost always counter-trend trading. </p>

								<h3>Persistence</h3>
								<p>To make money in trading, you must consistently be in net long position when the market is going up and be in net short position when the market is going down. Retails lose because their behaviors lead them to be in net short when the market goes up, and in net long when the market goes down- regardless of any indicators or strategies they might be using. If a trader is still following these losing behaviours, then Systems/Strategies are the absolute least important factor they should be looking at. When the herd is aggressively making counter-trend positions, they will always be wrong until they are right. They simply do not accept that they're in the wrong position, until either the market tops or bottoms happen. And when the trend reverses at these extreme tops or bottoms, the herd will be right... but only shortly, until they are wrong once again. Now i hope you can see part of the reason why the herd is losing. In a persistent trend, the herd positioning will be wrong (net short in an uptrend and net long in a downtrend); therefore, their losses are absolutely huge, until they reach the psychological relax at the top or bottom. When the price is at the tops and bottoms and starts reversing, then their psychology will (again) make them take small profits and let their losses run. Thus, they will reverse their positions too quickly and will end up on the wrong side (again). On the other hand, the Smart Money will lose money as the market reverse, and will make the most money as the trend persists.</p>

								<h3>Behaviour conclusion</h3>
								<p>In conclusion, as to the question"what psychological traits of retail cause the above behaviours?", there are two main reasons:
                                 <p> They always have an urge to catch tops & bottoms. </p>
                                <p> They hold onto large losses while taking small profits.</p>
                                <p> The herd consists of retail and commercial traders, whose main purpose is to hedge their currency exposure, but do not understand how the market moves - and thus, they possess similar psychological traits to the retails. Retails and commercial traders are in a similar position, because they are both uninformed and not on the professional speculative side. In the other hand, Smart Money (SM) is the big hand that can direct the market into a specific flow (trend) with superior information, discipline and lower risk.

                                <p> Additionally, once you develop better understandings of sentiment analysis, you can find the solutions to some of the most puzzling questions in the forex world, such as: </p>
                                <p> Can we reverse trading a losing strategy into a winning one ? ( My answer is YES)</p>
                                <p> The stop-loss hunting myth, is it true?</p>
                                <p> Is entry the most important thing in a system ?</p>
                                <p> Finally this will give you answers to almost any questions that may appear in your financial path. </p>
