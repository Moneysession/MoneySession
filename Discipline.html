									<h3>Who?</h3>
									<p> My name is Daniel, i'm the founder of Money Session brand and my day to day business is Forex Trading. Everything started when i was 19 years old when my passion for numbers took me on a jurney in the financial markets. For me, it all began with a question i had when i started my journey " Why are the percentages of unprofitable traders so unbelievably high?"
                                    </p>
                                    <P> It just didn't make sense to me that over 99% of traders will experience a net loss in the market. Out of more than 15 000 accounts opened at my broker, there would always only ever be 200-300 active accounts at once, with the rest of the accounts being inactive - or to put it another way, they incurred trading losses / margin called. So, the survival rate was around 1-2 %. The common phrase that "95% of retail traders are losers"  isn't wrong. In fact, if anything, the situation is probably worse, and i can certainly verify the statistics!</P>
                                    <p> I was extremely pazzled by this fact. I had heard about this statistic before, from just about everywhere in the trading world. However, it was only when i was actually working at the brokerage that i first became interested in understanding why. I thought, from a common statistical sense: "Yes, retails are always at a disadvantage, because they have to pay for spreads/ slippage; but even with these elements factored in, the stats should be somewhere around 40% profitable / 60% unprofitable, and not to the extreme of 1 out of 100. Also, Smart Money, like banks and hedge funds, have to pay the spreads, but they are not on the losing side of the market, so there must be something more going on here."And so, i set out on a journey to uncover the answer to this puzzle wich i putted together with a easy strategy to follow in the Money Session Program</p>

										<h3>Why?</h3>
										<p>My goal was to win this game because i don't want to end up in a 9 to 5 job with an average life. My mum was hustling nearly all day long when i was a kid and most of the time when she came home, she was tired from all that work stress. </p>
									</header>
									<p>So i decided at a very early age, that i want to live life on my own terms. This was my main motivation. Of course, i had some materialistic dreams as well, but living life on my own terms was really the most important one. In school, i had a lot of struggles because of my problem with authority. The only optin i had, was beeing my own boss. But how would i do that at such a young age, without any special degree for running a business + limited investment capital ?  After going through a artist career i did my research accordingly and then i found Forex Trading. I felt in love with the idea, to let my money work for me, so i wanted to master this skill. Several years later i can say that i have mastered this skill. I make a living off trading and live my life on my own terms. I can do what i want every day, that's freedom.</p>
                                    <p> It was not always like that. Especially in the first years, there were a lot of failures. I blew up a couple of accounts while i was working in silly jobs. I have put nearly all my earnings from the side-hustles into my trading account because i wanted it so bad. Now i know that this was one of my biggest problems back then. I wanted it so bad. Every time i took a loss i wanted to have it back as fast as i can, so i was not really trading. I was just gambling most of the time, and whenever i lost a trade, i was feeling the pain. It was a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Even if it was a lot of pain sometimes, i really enjoyed the thrill of Trading. The idea of letting the money work for me inspired me.</p>

										<h4>Inspiration</h4>
										<p>"We all have anxiety about things. We all have little insecurities, and everybody has some fear of failure. You have to face your fears if you want to be succesful!"</p>
									</header>
									<p>You must align all of your activities to the achievement of your goals, make a list of the ten most important goals in your life and focus your time on achieving those. Eliminate time-wasting activities that have nothing to do with your goals, you need to be focused on success, champions have a clear focus on what they want to achieve, they rid their life of people and things that are holding them back, time does not wait for anyone, change it up today, demand more from yourself, become the person you need to be to take your life to a whole new level, no more average living, the time has come for you to push yourself, wake up and grind for greatness, and seize the opportunity in front of you.
<p>If you don’t step it up to a new level now, when is the right time, you waiting for nothing, when are you going to get started on living your dreams? do you want to be like everyone else, wasting their days engaging in nonsense, look at the masses, what do they do on a daily basis, they sit around watching TV, drinking, smoking, talking nonsense? how many hours do average people waste a day? at least 5hours, let me tell you ! People have the audacity to say they don’t have no time for success, but actually people have a lack of priorities, they have a lifetimes subscription to failure, and they never subscribe to success.

If you want to be like the successful individuals in life, do what the successful people do, don’t follow the average folk, they are in the bubble of mediocrity, open your eyes and see with clarity that the average way doesn’t enable you to live life at your full potential.
 </p>

<p>There is so much within you, there is untapped potential. Most people just spend their days in alignment with failure, for how many more days, months and years do you want to be like this? You hold the power to change your life, realize that it is you who is in charge, don’t let others dictate how you live your life, decide right now! how do you want to live your life, become that person today, no more nonsense, align your daily habits to success, and do what needs to be done. </p>
<p>
Focus on what is most important to the progression of your life, look at your daily habits, ask yourself before you engage in an activity: is this in alignment with my goals? is this activity going to help me move forward in life? is this activity a productive way in which I should spend my time? and is this activity something that successful people engage in daily? if the answers are no, then stop engaging in these activities. You’re the one who chooses to be like this, these low-level living activities don’t move your life in the right direction, they just hold you back from becoming and doing more with your life.</p>
<p>
    
Have a look at someone who is older than you living the average life, living the 9-5 grind. What do you think their daily habits are? Ask them! Do you think their habits are aligned to success or failure? Ask them! And listen to what they say attentively, after you find that information out, ask yourself: Do I want to be like that when I’m older? Let me tell you: no of course not! So change your daily habits or you are going to end up like them. What a waste of your greatness, to settle for mediocrity. No one said this is easy, if it was easy any loser will be successful, this takes hard work and dedication, so don’t say it’s hard to change, everything is hard in the beginning, but when you persist on the road to success you can achieve anything.</p>
